# Term Projects

## Introduction:

The term project is designed for students to integrate and extend knowledge acquired throughout the course and to apply that knowledge to solve a problem of substantial scope. Students are required to work in groups of 3 people. Experience suggests that successful teams require expertise in design, implementation, and project management. 

Your task is to design and develop a prototype retrieval system, using online APIs, Open Source software (e.g., Lucene, Lemur/Indri, etc) or Amazon Web Services.  Your team will bid for one of the projects that proposed by faculty and students in SIS. 

If a collection is needed to compose for the project, to realistically demonstrate the usefulness of the retrieval systems, the collection should contain at least 50- 60 documents. 

## Milestones for the project:

* Introduction of term project:			Unit 2
* Team formation deadline:			Unit 4
* Project Initial Presentation			Unit 8
* Final project presentation:			Unit 14
* Project Demo:					Last week

## A Short Intro of Our Project:

### Project Title

Search the Best Recipes! 

### Background

People may face the problem frequently that it is difficult to generate a dish by using the ingredients laid in the refrigerator. To solve this problem, the project collects as many as recipes throughout world wide web as the dataset, where each recipe contains information fields such as dish name, ingredients needed and cooking steps. User can simply input the ingredients they have and the retrieval system would retrieve the full-text recipes that related to user's cooking needs. In addition, the returned recipes will be ranked by specific algorithms to satisfy the user's expectation of best recipes.

### Outcome

A search engine that returns the most relevant recipes according to the input query, including ingredients, dishes, cooking steps. The query can provide several ingredients or a dish name. 


## Instructor's feedback to the introduction 

Searching for recipes has been a popular project topic. It has lots of resources available online, and also contain some interesting challenges to work on. So can you tell me more about how do you define the best recipe? What do you envision the inputs from the users, and what retrieval system do you plan to use, and how you plan to present the outputs.

Furthermore, how do you plan to construct the index for recipes?

I think that these are interesting and important questions to consider when you try to put more details into your project design.


## Next step: Term Project Proposal Presentation

* Project name and team members
* What is the search problem in the project?
* The teamâ€™s motivations to the project
* What are the major inputs/outputs of the system? 
* What is your approach and plan?
* Major steps of your approach
* Current status, schedule until the end of the term
